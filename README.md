 Quiz Game Exercise for Homework Assignment

## Introduction

The game is simple enough, given an amount of time, can you correctly answer five questions.  If you choose a wrong answer, a minute will be deducted from the clock and a score will be recorded.

If you answer all five questions or the timer runs out, then it will be game over and will desplay your score out of 100 and the time left.

The question and answers are based off of an introduction to biochemistry slide deck and future releases will include the ability to parse a properly formatted deck to generate the questions and answer choices to use to study with.
